# Test 5. ConnectFour game
Implement the ConnectFour game as a web application with one mode: ```play against a friend (on the same computer).```

You can find more information about the game at Wikipedia. A reference implementation may be found on the App Store. You can use image assets from this reference implementation or that you find online.

The deliverable will be a code repository we can browse through and clear instructions for accessing/installing the app.

Please provide us a projected delivery date. Your priorities are:
Hit the deadline you assign yourself with all requirements met.
Produce beautiful and maintainable code (You may wish to spend a few moments thinking of how another developer may wish to extend your work.).
